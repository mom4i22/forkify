# forkify
Final project from my JS course
This is a webapp about cooking recipes. You can upload your own recipe and only you will be able to see it and it will be automatically added to your bookmarks. You
can also search for recipes but be careful because a search result will only appear if you've written a full known word. The search will also show you results about the
first word in your search field and not take any leftovers after it into consideration -> homemade pizza will show you search results about homemade meals. You can also
change the servings and the required products will be updated accordingly. Bookmark recipes that you like so that you can check them out later as well. :)
